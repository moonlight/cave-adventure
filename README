Moonlight Productions :: Cave Adventure
---------------------------------------

Here is our second small RPG, a Cave Adventure. It's been made for the Spring
2003 MiniRPG compo. After washing down a river, Frode (the main character)
fell down a waterfall and just managed to reach out for a branch that was
hanging about halfway down. Incidently, swinging towards the rock side, there
happens to be an entrance to a cave behind the wall of water. Frode has the
choice between either falling drop dead on the rocks below the waterfall or
entering the cave to face the perils within. Naturally, in the spirit of bold
exploration, he enters the cave...

The Moonlight RPG engine
------------------------

This RPG uses the Moonlight RPG engine, which is licensed under GPL and will 
be distributed seperately when it's mature enough. Its current specifications 
are:

- Allegro for graphics, keyboard input and timers
- AllegroOGG for OGG file playback
- Using the Lua extension language for the scripting
- Using object oriented, flexible tile engine
- Comes with its own map/tile editor
- Allows use of multiple tile bitmaps per map, and the other way around


-------------------
Config file options
-------------------

In RPG.cfg you can specify if you want to run the RPG fullscreen or windowed.
You can also enable vsync there (might look smoother for some users). Further 
more, if you are running in windowed mode, you might want to enable the double 
size feature. You can also use this with the fullscreen mode if your videocard 
doesn't support 320x240 high/truecolor modes.

If the game runs choppy, try reducing the colordepth to 16 or 15 bit.
